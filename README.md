# Node.js Master Class

deployed to: http://monitor-api.now.sh/

I am taking this class because:

1.  I want to master node.js
2.  I want to build a complete server from the ground up
3.  I want to be able to build my own api's from scratch
4.  Become more familiar with building configuration for your own projects
