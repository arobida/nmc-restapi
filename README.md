# Node.js Master Class

I am taking this class because:

1. I want to master node.js
2. I want to build a complete server from the ground up
3. I want to be able to build my own api's from scratch
4. Become more familiar with building configuration for your own projects

With these skills the last thing i need to learn is graphql for now and I should be able to build my own full stack products from the ground up that are sustainable and scalable.
